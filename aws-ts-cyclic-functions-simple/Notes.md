# Notes

## Interesting engine changes

- Allow duplicate urns
- New op codes
- Update preview diff before resource actually created
- Discard dependencies which cause cycles in state

## Future thoughts

- New update grpc method
- Patching vs updating
- Deleting temporary resources
- Keep circular dependencies in state
- Is causing replacements valid?
